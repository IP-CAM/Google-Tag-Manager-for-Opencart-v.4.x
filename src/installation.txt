Playful Sparkle - Google Tag Manager

The Playful Sparkle - Google Tag Manager extension for OpenCart 4.x+ seamlessly
integrates Google Tag Manager (GTM) into your OpenCart eCommerce store without
requiring any coding knowledge. Simply enter your GTM Measurement ID, and the
tracking code is automatically injected into your site. This enables precise
tracking and data collection for services such as Google Ads, Google Analytics,
and other marketing tools.

This extension fully supports Google Consent Mode V2, which enhances privacy
compliance by allowing websites to adjust tracking behavior based on user
consent. Unlike the previous version, which only handled basic ad and analytics
storage permissions, Consent Mode V2 expands consent signals to include ad user
data and ad personalization preferences.

To make use of these consent settings, you must install a separate
Cookie Consent Banner to collect user choices. The extension automatically
configures GTM to respect these choices by dynamically setting consent states
for ad storage, analytics storage, security storage, functionality storage,
personalization storage, and ads data redaction.

Additionally, it supports URL Passthrough and allows setting a wait_for_update
delay to defer tracking until consent is granted.

This ensures compliance with GDPR, ePrivacy, and other data regulations while
maintaining effective analytics and ad tracking without slowing down your site.

This extension does not track Enhanced eCommerce events or ad conversions it
only configures default consent settings for Google Tag Manager. If you require
Enhanced eCommerce event tracking or Google Ads conversion tracking, you will
need an additional extension such as Google Analytics (GA4)/Ads Conversion
Enhanced Measurement for OpenCart 4.x+.

About Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a free tool that helps you manage marketing tags
(like analytics and tracking codes) on your website without needing to touch the
code. It lets marketers and developers add, update, and manage tags in
real-time, without the hassle of modifying the website code every time you want
to update or add a tag.

With GTM, you can easily integrate services like Google Ads, Google Analytics,
and other marketing tools. This extension simplifies the process by
automatically setting up GTM on your OpenCart store, so it's ready to track key
metrics with minimal effort.

About Google Consent Mode V2

Google Consent Mode V2 is a feature designed to help websites comply with
privacy regulations like GDPR by adjusting tracking behavior based on
user consent.

In Consent Mode V1, you could only manage basic tracking permissions, such as
ad storage and analytics storage. However, Consent Mode V2 extends these
capabilities, allowing websites to also manage consent for ad user data and
ad personalization preferences.

The main difference is that V2 offers more granular control over user consent.
With Consent Mode V2, you can set consent preferences for multiple types of
data (such as ad storage, analytics storage, and personalization storage) and
configure more privacy-conscious features like ads data redaction and
URL passthrough.

To use Consent Mode V2, you must install a separate cookie consent banner to
collect user preferences. Once the user provides consent, the extension
automatically applies the selected settings to Google Tag Manager, ensuring
compliant tracking across your store.
